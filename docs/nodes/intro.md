# Nodes

Nodes are put into 5 groups, where each group has it's own purpose.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Spawn Group** contains nodes, which tell the system when and how many particles to create.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Initialize Group** contains nodes that tell the system what to do with the particle when it's being created.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Update Group** contains nodes that tell the system how to handle the particles when they’re alive.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Render Group** contains nodes that tell the system how to display the particle.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Logic Group** contains nodes that utilize connections and don’t go inside the systems.

_Sidenote: I would hope that the nodes themselves have self explanatory names and fields._

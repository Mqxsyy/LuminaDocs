# Redesign UI

In all honesty I'm not that big of a fan of the UI. I'd like to do a full redesign with probably some code changes as well. But since this would be a massive undertaking (maybe a month) it's VERY low on the priority. (And also by the time I'd get around to this I may have already slowly changed it to something that I like more)

This would probably not be a full rewrite from ground up since I don't believe that the code is bad or inflexible, just visual changes for the most part.

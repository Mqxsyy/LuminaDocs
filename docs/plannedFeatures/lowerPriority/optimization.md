# Optimization

I want this plugin to be as optimized as possible but before that I want it to be something actually unique.

This would include:

-   Culling
-   Thtrottling
-   Parallel Luau
-   Native Code Generation
-   Better implementation of Object Pooling

I'd also like to add a quality controller to make it simpler to reduce the amount of vfxs for lower end devices.

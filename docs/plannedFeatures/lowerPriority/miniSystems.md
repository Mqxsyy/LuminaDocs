# Mini Systems

I feel like there will be many times when a bunch of logic might be repeating so I'd like to add a way to remove the need of duplicating nodes but instead make it so you could put all that logic inside a "mini system" and then use that system wherever you wish to use that same logic.

Something like the DRY principle and functions in programming.

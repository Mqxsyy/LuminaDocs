# Planned Features

:::warning
This is NOT a definitive list, just an overview and everything is subject to change.
:::

This plugin is by far not complete and nowhere near what my end goal is. For a better understanding of what I want out of this plugin I've listed some of my upcoming plans.

These features include the UI and well as the underlying systems.

When or even if these become reality, I can not say, since after all I'm doing this purely from my passion and out of my own free time with absolutely no funding.

Also these are in no specific order and the descriptions may not be the best but at least they should give some sort of idea.
<br/>

**tl;dr of features**:<br/>
I want it to be able to make any full vfx and almost fully remove the necessity of programming.

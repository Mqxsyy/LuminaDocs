# A Bunch Of Logic

Currently there's only a random number node but I want there to be a lot more to add the potential for really complex behaviors. These nodes wouldn't be complex but with correct use they could prove to be really useful.

Ex. add, subtract, multiply, divide, negate, clamp, remap, sin, cos.

In addition I'd add some inputs that could include: particle alivetime and global time.

# Custom Variables

Having to retype the same number over and over again is annoying. So I'd like to add some form of custom variables, a number that you could define once and use in many different places.

As a side effect this would also increase the customizability of a vfx by a substantial amount. You could just define a color in once place and then easily change it later and it would change everywhere that it should change.

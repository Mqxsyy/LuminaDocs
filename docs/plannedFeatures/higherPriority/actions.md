When a particle dies then who says it's contribution has ended? Why not add a way for that particle that died to spawn even more particles at the location of it's death. This would make it so you could actually make accurate rain puddles and sparkling fireworks, _or fireworks in general._

Or why not spawn more partilces when a particle collides with something? or why not just trigger some function?

Basically just add ways for particles to start new things themselves.

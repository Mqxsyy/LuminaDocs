# Different Velocity Changers

Currently this plugin really only offers one directional non chaotic velocity, _unless you pair a random number node with a velocity node_, but even that is not ideal.

I want there to be options to make particles move in a more choatic and randomized way. One such node would be turbulence.

I also want there to be ones that increase control over particles in a non chaotic way. An example would be to have a node that makes the particle move towards a specific point in 3D space, and if the particle would overshoot it then it would readjust it's velocity back to that target position.

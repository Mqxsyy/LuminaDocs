# Shape Spawns

Currently this plugin only allows for point spawns or randomized spawn locations but I want to add a simple way to make particles spawn in an ellipse, square, cube shape. (probably in many more shapes)

This would also include some shape specific spawn velocity, ex. particles spawned in a shpere would all evenly shoot out.
